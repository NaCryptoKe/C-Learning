# Project 2: This is a smart ware house system trying to increase my skill in smar pointers

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
---
Design a mini warehouse system that handles packages stored in storage units, and workers who move them â€” using smart pointers with correct, deliberate ownership semantics.

Youâ€™re building a system that models:

- Package â†’ uniquely owned, lightweight objects (unique_ptr)

- StorageUnit â†’ owns multiple packages

- Warehouse â†’ owns multiple storage units (shared_ptr)

- Worker â†’ can temporarily access packages via weak_ptr references
